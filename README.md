## Overview

This app simulates a real-life cash register: it takes a total price and cash input from the customer and returns the appropriate change using the cash available in the drawer. The drawer is pre-filled with defined amounts of each denomination.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox + responsive styling)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- DOM manipulation
- Media queries for mobile responsiveness

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

- Floating point arithmetic in JavaScript (working with money)
- Conditional logic and array manipulation
- Responsive navigation with a custom hamburger menu
- Clean UI state updates and DOM rendering

## Continued development

In the future, I'd like to:

- Create a more complete product listing system with quantity selection
- Implement additional pages accessible from the navigation menu
- Add a basic login system to simulate user access
